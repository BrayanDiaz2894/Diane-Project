Diane Project

This repository contains a fully reproducible analysis for the Advanced Econometrics course (ETX5551 at Monash University).

How to run the project

1. Download or clone the repository  
   You can download the ZIP from GitHub or clone it via Git:
   git clone https://github.com/BrayanDiaz2894/Diane-Project.git

2. Open the RStudio project  
   Open the file named Diane.Rproj. This will automatically set the correct working directory.

3. Render the Quarto document  
   Open the file assign03-Brayan.qmd and click the Render button at the top of RStudio, or use this command in the console:
   quarto::render("assign03-Brayan.qmd")

Required R packages

Make sure the following packages are installed before rendering:

- dplyr  
- tidyr  
- ggplot2  
- broom  
- effectsize  
- MASS  
- caret  
- here  
- mulgar  
- readr

You can install them all with:

install.packages(c(
  "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "broom",
  "effectsize", "MASS", "caret", "here",
  "mulgar", "readr"
))

Project structure

- Diane.Rproj – RStudio project file (open this first)  
- assign03-Brayan.qmd – Main Quarto analysis (render this)  
- data/ – All required datasets  
- setup.R – Supporting script for consistent setup  
- assignment.css – Custom styling for the output  
- assign03-Brayan.html – Rendered HTML output  
- .gitignore, .RData, .Rhistory – Project environment files

Reproducibility notes

- All paths are relative to the root of the project.  
- Warnings and messages are suppressed in the output.  
- The script uses here::here() for robust file path handling.
